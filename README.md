# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

I've been reading a bit about refactoring and unit tests. 

Being practicing one of the best ways to learn something, I ended finding up the Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata in the following repository: [Emily Bache's](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).

I think the final code is better than the initial one.

The guide for this kata can be found in the [original repository](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)
